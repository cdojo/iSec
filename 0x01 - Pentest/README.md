## 0x01 - Penetration Test

A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test, is an authorized simulated attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. The test is performed to identify both weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

## 0x02 - Tools

The Kali Linux penetration testing platform contains a vast array of tools and utilities, from information gathering to final reporting, that enable security and IT professionals to assess the security of their systems. [Tools Kali](https://tools.kali.org/tools-listing)

## 0x03 - Steps

### 0x03.1 - Pre-engagement

Before the pentest begins, pentesters perform pre-engagement interactions with the client to make sure everyone is on the same page about the penetration testing. Miscommunication between a pentester and a client who expects a simple vulnerability scan could lead to a sticky situation bacause penetration test are much more intrusive.

### 0x03.2 - Information Gathering

Next is the information-gathering phase. During this phase, you analyze freely avaiable sources of information, a process known as gathering *open source intelligence (OSINT)*. You also begin to use tools such as port scanners to get an idea of what systems are out there on the Internet or internal network as well as what software is running.

### 0x03.3 - Threat Modeling

Based on the knowledge gained in the information-gathering phase, we move on threat modeling. Here we think like attackers and develop plans of attack based on the information we've gathered. Based on the data we found during information gathering, we develop strategies to penetrate a client's systems.

### 0x03.4 - Vulnerability Analysis

Next, discover vulnerabilities to determine how successful their exploit strategies might be. Run vulnerability scanners, ehich use vulnerability databases and a series of active checks to make a guess about chich vulnerabilities are present on a client's system.
